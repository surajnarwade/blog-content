On 3rd January 2016, I was practising in my institute  for my *RHCSA in OpenStack certification*, it was around 11:45 pm and suddenly, My Instructor *Ashutosh* Sir told me regarding internship interview at Red Hat on 10th January. I started preparing for interview immediately . (First Job interview, little bit tension, few days left)

Surprisingly, there was a call from Red Hat ( First Telephonic interview by Rishabh Das) on 7 Jan 2016 in morning, for a while I thought it was from GSS team, I cracked it and I got script( it was shell & python script) to write  for second round of screening, I completed it and submitted on next day itself(one day before deadline because there was exam scheduled on next day)

On 9th of January, My RHCSA in OpenStack exam was there I was bit worried because I have to come to Pune  for internship interview process on 10th January conducted by GSS team.

I cleared both Aptitude and group discussion round and then interview was taken by *Piyush Yaduvanshi* (I came to know about my exam result  just before entering room for interview, was happy because no matter what happens there, but I was Red Hat certified System Administrator in OpenStack now :P) , & was awesome!
   

On 11 January, Again *Rishabh* interviewed me regarding script that what I wrote for second round and day was gone in worry worry worry...

On next day morning, *Soni Lonari* called me and told that I was selected and should join from 8 February, immediately I asked my friend (*Abhijeet Sadawarte*-ATSE) who is in GSS team that will I get Red Hat email-id and then Happiness was that I can never explain...and journey beginsâ€¦
