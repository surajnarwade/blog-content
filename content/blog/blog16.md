Woo! It was so exciting, because It was my First [PyCon]( <https://in.pycon.org/2016/>`_) ,First conference, First flight and  First time Delhi.
1. Was so excited to meet all new people who were known  over IRC,dgplug and social media volunteer(PyCon) only.
   We landed in the capital city at around 2 am in the morning (terrible experience in Indigo flight) . Then, we went to our Stay point [Mulberry house](https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/9891304?checkin=15-11-2016&checkout=26-11-2016&guests=10&s=nJSEVSE5) (one of my memorable places in Delhi) :P
   

*Day1*

We reached the venue early to have delicious breakfast (Since PyCon is known for its food too) and setting up for volunteering. I volunteered [“Demystifying the Django REST Framework: Web Development”](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/demystifying-the-django-rest-framework~dBNxd/) By [Haris Ibrahim K. V](https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv). The strength of the hall was quite good :). The workshop was really helpful as I get to know about Django also.

Then, we headed up for lunch. In the afternoon session, I was the volunteer lead for [“Scaling Django with Kubernetes: Infrastructure”](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/scaling-django-with-kubernetes~boONb/) by [Saket Bhushan](https://twitter.com/5aket), I introduced Saket to the crowd and handed over the stage to him. I was aware of kubernetes, but got to know about how Django app is deployed with kubernetes as well as how to deploy kubernetes UI which helps in monitoring over the cluster. We also had hands-on session in the workshop.
Devsprints also started on the Day1, there were lots of projects like pagure, ansible containers, sympy etc.
Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the dev sprint due to some other work.
The day ended with volunteer gathering, feedback session and next day planning :)

*Day2*

Day2 started with KG award(one of the prestigious awards in community ) felicitation ceremony to [Dr Ajith Kumar B.P](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2016/Winner-of-Kenneth-Gonsalves-Award-2016.html).

Now It was time to encourage, appreciate the efforts of [Python Express](https://pythonexpress.in/) volunteers. We all gathered on the stage. It was an awesome feeling( huge round of applause) :).  We, volunteers conducted Around 88 workshops in 11 states in this python month(10th august to 10th September). Thinking of such grand success, we have decided to run this python express for all 365 days.

- "Programmer think like bricklayers”
- “The world is not a program, it's a system... and it's distributed”

It was around 4.30 pm and it was time for our 2nd keynote speaker, [Van Lindberg](https://twitter.com/vanl) , Vice President of RackSpace.
Some of the Key points from his talk :
We should discuss failure also because it also plays essential role in software development
as failure is the source of GROWTH and responding to failure is a personal responsibility.

Things that PyCon makes better:

- Come to Contribute
- Meet someone new
- Say Thanks!
  

Dealing with failure:

- Increase skill or capacity
- Increase domain knowledge
- Think more clearly and powerfully
  

Avoiding Failure:

- Make our assumptions explicit
- Test our assumptions
- Embrace change

As per Andreas,

- Machine learning is everywhere.

In afternoon, we had [dgplug](https://dgplug.org/) staircase(actually ramp :P) meeting which takes place every year in PyCon India :), [Kushal](https://twitter.com/kushaldas) took feedback regarding summer training program. Lots of discussion happened regarding how dgplug can be better, IRC, why to contribute to opensource.
Kushal introduced us to his mentor, [Sirtaj Singh Kang](http://www.sirtaj.net/) who helped him to get started with python
After that, Kushal presented Red Hat sponsored talk on “Python in Red Hat family”, How python plays important role in Red Hat’s Opensource projects like Anaconda, RDO, ansible, etc(Pythonistas by heart)
