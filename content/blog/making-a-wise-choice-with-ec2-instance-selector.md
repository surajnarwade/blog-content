AWS has more than 200 instance types under EC2\. It's very tricky to select appropriate ec2\-instance types and surely AWS docs can be daunting.


You can check the official doc here: [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance\-types/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)


ec2\-instance\-selector is an open\-source project by AWS. It is a CLI tool to helps you select compatible instance types.


Check out the repo here,


[https://github.com/aws/amazon\-ec2\-instance\-selector](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ec2-instance-selector)
 


### **Features**


* You can filter AWS Instance types using criteria like vcpu, memory, network performance, etc.
* You can use this project as a Go library to embed this functionality into your Golang projects, I will surely embed this in [awsctl](https://github.com/surajincloud/awsctl).


Installing ec2\-instance\-selector
----------------------------------


* On Mac



```
brew tap aws/tap
brew install ec2-instance-selector

```

* On Linux \& Windows, you can download the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ec2-instance-selector/releases/tag/v2.4.1).
* verify installation



```
ec2-instance-selector --version
v2.4.1

```

Usage
-----


* Lookup all the instance type details interactively



```
ec2-instance-selector -o interactive

```

* Not all regions have all the instance types, so you can pass the region of your choice via `--region` flag



```
ec2-instance-selector --region eu-west-2

```

* If you are looking for a specific vcpu or memory count, you can pass flags as shown below,



```
ec2-instance-selector --vcpus 4 --memory 16
g4ad.xlarge
g4dn.xlarge
g5.xlarge
im4gn.xlarge
...
...

```

* you can also print in tabular format,



```
➜ ec2-instance-selector --vcpus 4 --memory 16 -o table

These are just a few examples of `ec2-instance-selector` but you can do much more such as finding instances by prices, CPU architecture, EBS, etc.


You can find this information in the help section,



```
ec2-instance-selector --help

```
