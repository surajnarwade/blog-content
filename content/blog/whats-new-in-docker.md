* Recently, I installed latest docker on my machine. But I noticed lots of new features, commands and aliases to the existing commands and felt it was worth posting.

* Docker version that I installed is 17.03.0-ce, [Click here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/fedora/) to know how to install Docker
